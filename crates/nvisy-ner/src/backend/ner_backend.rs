//! [`NerBackend`]: the unified per-call NER backend trait.
//!
//! Replaces the previous split between `GlinerBackend` (zero-shot,
//! takes per-call kinds) and `NlpEngine`-produced NER spans
//! (fixed-label, no per-call kinds). The `labels` field on
//! [`NerRequest`] is `Option<&[&str]>`: `Some(...)` for zero-shot
//! backends that take a label allowlist per call, `None` for
//! fixed-label backends whose set of labels is baked into the
//! model.
//!
//! Engines are called from inside [`NerRecognizer::recognize`] — no
//! shared NLP pass, no orchestrator plumbing. Each recognizer holds
//! its own backend and is self-contained.
//!
