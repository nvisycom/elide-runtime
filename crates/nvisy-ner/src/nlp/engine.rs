//! [`NlpEngine`]: the producer-side trait that builds the
//! shared-NLP-pass [`TypeMap`] for one or more texts.
//!
//! Engines stamp typed enrichment entries (`LanguageDetections`
//! today; token artifacts when the upstream service supports
//! them) into the returned `TypeMap`. An orchestrator that wants
//! shared NLP runs `process` once per scan, wraps the result in
//! [`Artifacts`], and attaches it to each [`RecognizerInput`] via
//! [`RecognizerInput::with_artifacts`].
//!
//! [`Artifacts`]: nvisy_core::extraction::Artifacts
//! [`RecognizerInput`]: nvisy_core::recognition::RecognizerInput
//! [`RecognizerInput::with_artifacts`]: nvisy_core::recognition::RecognizerInput::with_artifacts
//!
//! Pluggable so different deployment shapes (pure language
//! detection, hosted full-NLP service, future in-process model)
//! can be wired interchangeably. The orchestrator calls `process`
//! (or `process_batch`) once per scan; recognizers and the
//! keyword-boost enhancer borrow the resulting map by reference.
