# Shipped asset tree

The `nvisy-pattern` crate compiles every TOML and term-source
file under this directory into the binary via `include_str!`,
so adding a pattern or dictionary is as simple as:

1. Drop the asset into the right subtree.
2. Wire a `shipped_pattern!` / `shipped_dictionary!` accessor
   in `src/shipped/{patterns,dictionaries}/<scope>.rs`.
3. Append the accessor to the sub-module's `all()`.

The recognizer's per-call language and country fields filter
patterns + dictionaries at runtime — see
[`RecognizerInput::applies_to_language`] and
[`RecognizerInput::applies_to_country`].

## Layout

```
assets/
  patterns/
    world/                 jurisdiction-agnostic regex patterns
      contact/             email, phone, url
      credentials/         aws, github, stripe, generic api, private key
      finance/             credit card, iban, swift, btc, eth
      network/             ipv4, ipv6, mac
      personal/            date of birth, datetime
    us/                    US-jurisdiction patterns
      identity/            ssn, itin, drivers_license, passport, postal_code
      finance/             bank_routing, bank_account
      health/              npi, mbi, medical_license (DEA)
    uk/                    UK-jurisdiction patterns
      identity/            nhs, nino, driving_licence, passport
      contact/             postcode
      vehicle/             registration

  dictionaries/
    world/                 universal: brand names + codes
      finance/             cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, Bitcoin, …)
    en/                    English-language terms
      finance/             currencies (USD, US Dollar, EUR, …)
      personal/            languages, nationalities, religions
```

Each pattern is a TOML file (`<name>.toml`). Each dictionary
pairs a TOML metadata sidecar with a term source:
`.csv` for multi-column lists (term + alias columns with
per-column scores), `.txt` for one-per-line lists.

## Scoring conventions

Scores are baseline confidence — the context enhancer (in
`nvisy-context`) lifts them when configured keywords appear
nearby. The toolkit's default confidence threshold is `0.35`;
anything below needs context boost or an out-of-band hint
(CSV column header, JSON object key, HTML parent text) to
clear it.

| Tier | Score | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| Strong | 0.95–0.98 | Branded credential headers (`AKIA…`, `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`, `gh[pousr]_…`) |
| Solid  | 0.4–0.5   | Format with a checksum or restrictive structure (IBAN, NHS, NPI, MBI, IPv4, MAC, IPv6) |
| Loose  | 0.3       | Brand-aware with weak structural specificity (credit_card, dictionaries) |
| Weak   | 0.1       | Generic shape that *requires* context to clear threshold (passport, postal_code, DoB) |
| Trace  | 0.05      | Last-resort generic regex (bank_account `\b\d{8,17}\b`) |

The targets mirror Microsoft Presidio's deliberately-conservative
baselines — most of Presidio's predefined recognizers sit in
0.1–0.5 because the context enhancer is expected to lift hits
to 0.6+ when surrounding tokens match.

## Validators

A pattern variant can declare `validator = "<name>"` to drop
matches that fail a post-match structural check. Built-in
names (resolved via `ValidatorRegistry::builtin`):

- Universal: `luhn`, `iban`, `phone`, `date`, `crypto.btc`
- US: `us.ssn`, `us.aba_routing`, `us.npi`, `us.dea_number`,
  `us.postal_code`
- UK: `uk.nhs`, `uk.nino`, `uk.driving_licence`,
  `uk.vehicle_registration`

Each lives in `src/validators/` under the matching submodule.

## Attribution

Many patterns + validators are ports of upstream Microsoft
Presidio recognizers. See [`PRESIDIO.md`](PRESIDIO.md) for the
MIT-license attribution and the upstream class references that
each adapted TOML's leading comment links to.
